1.0 06/03/2012   
Initial Release

1.1 06/24/2012   
Fix for non-english unit conversion. (commas instead of decimal points, etc).

1.2 07/05/2012   
Added a prefix to all cache files for api calls made against the test server.
Added a fix for unexpected 'bool.parse' method suddenly missing.
Removed the trailing '\' character from the EVEConstants.eveServerStatusUri string that was causing issues with determining the cache file name.
License changed from Boost license to MIT license (to satisfy Goole Code)
Added a try/catch around APIReader:Query for WebExceptions.

1.2.1 07/19/2012 
The format of cache file names has been changed.  Rather than including the entire argument line in the filename, the argument list is now encoded as an MD5 hash.  
This resolves an issue where certain API calls could generate cache file names that exceeded the OS filename length limits.

Now caching the return of 'IsCorpKey' to reduce the number of unnecessary web requests.

1.2.2 08/20/2012
Adjusted 'roleID' in CharacterSheet.Role to be an Int64, per a post by Virppi Jouhinen (from the 'Elinor' project) where she indicated an out of range exception.
			   
1.2.3 07/19/2013
Added StarbaseList and StarbaseDetail, updated some random crap and made sure all the current calls work.
