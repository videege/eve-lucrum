For most of that time it saw service as a mining ship, its size barring it from making any kind of impact on the battlefield. As with most Amarr ships, however, its strong defenses always made it a tough opponent to crack, and with recent advances in turret capacitor use and damage output, its lasers have now stopped digging into dead ore and are instead focused on boring through the hulls of hapless vessels in combat.|72
592|25|Navitas|The Navitas is a Support Frigate designed to rapidly repair allied vessels in combat. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3328>Gallente Frigate</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 10% bonus to Remote Armor Repair System repair amount 10% reduction in Remote Armor Repair System capacitor use <br><b>Role Bonus:</b> 500% bonus to range of remote armor repair systems <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Gallente Federation, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Navitas.  The Navitas had been a solid mining vessel that had seen wide use by independent excavators, along with being one of the best ships available for budding traders and even for much-maligned scavengers. After its redesign, its long-range scanners and sturdy outer shell gave way entirely for remote repairing capabilities, moving the Navitas away from the calming buzz of mining lasers and into the roar of battle.|77

Interestingly enough, it has been used by both the Caldari Navy and several wealthy trade corporations as a cargo-hauling vessel. It is one of few trading vessels with good punching power, making it ideal for solo trade-runs in dangerous areas. The Kestrel was designed so that it could take up to four missile launchers but as a result it can not be equipped with turret weapons nor with mining lasers.|61
603|25|Merlin|The Merlin is a Combat Frigate designed for frontline fighting. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3330>Caldari Frigate</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 4% bonus to shield resistances 5% bonus to Small Hybrid Turret damage <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Merlin is the most powerful combat frigate of the Caldari. Its role has evolved through the years, and while its defenses have always remained exceptionally strong for a Caldari vessel, its offensive capabilities have evolved from versatile, jack-of-all-trades attack patterns into focused and deadly gunfire tactics. The Merlin's primary aim is to have its turrets punch holes in opponents' hulls.|61
605|25|Heron|The Heron is a Frigate designed for exploring the depths of space. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3330>Caldari Frigate</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 7.5% increase to scan strength of probes 5% bonus to Salvager cycle time <br><b>Role Bonus:</b> +5 Virus Strength to Relic and Data Analyzers <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Heron has good computer and electronic systems, giving it the option of participating in electronic warfare.

It was first deployed on the market as a fast passenger craft but the extra passenger quarters were later modified into weapon hardpoints as the newer models came to be used for small-scale security and military duties. The Velator is still a very solid mining and trading vessel.|77
607|25|Imicus|The Imicus is a Frigate designed for exploring the depths of space. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3328>Gallente Frigate</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 7.5% increase to scan strength of probes 5% bonus to Salvager cycle time <br><b>Role Bonus:</b> +5 Virus Strength to Relic and Data Analyzers <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Imicus is a slow but hard-shelled frigate, ideal for any type of scouting activity. Used by merchant, miner and combat groups, the Imicus is usually relied upon as the operation's eyes and ears when traversing low security sectors.|77
608|25|Atron|The Atron is an Attack Frigate designed for fast aggressive combat. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3328>Gallente Frigate</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 10% bonus to Small Hybrid Turret falloff 5% bonus to Small Hybrid Turret damage <br><b>Role Bonus:</b> 80% reduction in Propulsion Jamming systems activation cost <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Atron is a hard nugget with an advanced power conduit system, but little space for cargo.

Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Caldari State the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Osprey.  The Osprey originally offered excellent versatility and power for what was considered a comparably low price. After its redesign, its inbuilt mining technology - now a little creaky and long in the tooth - was gutted from the Osprey and replaced in its entirety with tech of a different type, capable of high energy and shield transfers.|75
621|26|Caracal|The Caracal is an Attack Cruiser designed for fast aggressive combat. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3334>Caldari Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 5% bonus Rapid Light, Heavy Assault and Heavy Missile Launcher rate of fire 10% bonus to Light, Heavy Assault and Heavy Missile Velocity  <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Caracal is a powerful vessel that specializes in missile deployment.

It is light and extremely fast, yet surprisingly powerful, with a wide variety of weapons. It is one of few Minmatar vessels that have reached popularity outside Minmatar space.|73
623|26|Moa|The Moa is a Combat Cruiser designed for frontline fighting. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3334>Caldari Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 5% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret damage 4% bonus to shield resistances <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Moa was designed as an all-out combat ship, and its heavy armament allows the Moa to tackle almost anything that floats in space.

Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Amarr Empire the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Augoror.  The Augoror-class cruiser is one of the old warhorses of the Amarr Empire, having seen action in both the Jovian War and the Minmatar Rebellion. Like most Amarr vessels, the Augoror depended first and foremost on its resilience and heavy armor to escape unscathed from unfriendly encounters. After its overhaul, it had some of the armor stripped off to make room for equipment allowing it to focus on the armor of other vessels, along with energy transfers.|74
626|26|Vexor|The Vexor is a Combat Cruiser designed for frontline fighting. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3332>Gallente Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 5% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret damage 10% bonus to drone hitpoints, damage and mining yield <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Vexor is a strong combat ship that is also geared to operate in a variety of other roles. The Vexor is especially useful for surveying in potentially hostile sectors as it can stay on duty for a very long time before having to return to base. Furthermore, it is well capable of defending itself against even concentrated attacks.|76
627|26|Thorax|The Thorax is an Attack Cruiser designed for fast aggressive combat. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3332>Gallente Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 5% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret damage 7.5% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret tracking speed <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Thorax-class cruiser is the latest combat ship commissioned by the Federation. While the Thorax is a very effective ship at any range, typical of modern Gallente design philosophy it is most effective when working at extreme close range where its blasters and hordes of combat drones tear through even the toughest of enemies.|76
628|26|Arbitrator|The Arbitrator is a Cruiser designed for disrupting enemy ships using electronic warfare. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3335>Amarr Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 7.5% bonus to Tracking Disruptor effectiveness 10% bonus to drone hitpoints, damage and mining yield <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Arbitrator is unusual for Amarr ships in that it's primarily a drone carrier.

While not quite in the league of newer navy cruisers, the Bellicose is still a very solid ship for most purposes, especially in terms of long range combat.|73
631|26|Scythe|The Scythe is a Support Cruiser designed to rapidly repair allied vessels in combat. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3333>Minmatar Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 12.5% bonus to Shield Transporter boost amount 5% reduction in Shield Transporter capacitor use <br><b>Role Bonus:</b> 1000% bonus to Shield Transporter range 100% bonus to Logistic Drone repair amount <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Minmatar Republic  the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Scythe.  The Scythe-class cruiser remains the oldest Minmatar ship still in use. It has seen many battles and is an integrated part in Minmatar tales and heritage. With its redesign, past firmware upgrades for mining output were tossed out entirely in favor of two new separate systems that focused on shield transporting and logistics drones respectively.|73
632|26|Blackbird|The Blackbird is a Cruiser designed for disrupting enemy ships using electronic warfare. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3334>Caldari Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 15% bonus to ECM Target Jammer strength 12.5% bonus to ECM Target Jammer optimal range and falloff <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> The Blackbird is a small high-tech cruiser newly employed by the Caldari Navy.

634|26|Exequror|The Exequror is a Support Cruiser designed to rapidly repair allied vessels in combat. <br><font size="14"><b>Traits</b></font> <b><a href=showinfo:3332>Gallente Cruiser</a> skill bonus per level:</b> 12.5% bonus to Remote Armor Repair System repair amount 5% reduction in Remote Armor Repair System capacitor use <br><b>Role Bonus:</b> 1000% bonus to Remote Armor Repair System range 100% bonus to Logistic Drone repair amount <br><font size="14"><b>Development</b></font> In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Gallente Federation the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Exequoror.  The Exequror was a heavy cargo cruiser originally strong enough to defend itself against raiding frigates, though it lacked prowess in heavier combat situations. After its redesign, it had some of that bulk - and, necessarily, some of that strength - yanked out and replaced with the capability to help others in heavy combat situations, in particular those who needed armor repairs.|76

Its distinguishing aspect - and the source of most of the controversy - is its sheer versatility, variously seen as either a lack of design focus or a deliberate freedom for pilot modification. |78

While no longer regarded as the king of the hill, it is by no means obsolete. Its formidable hulk and powerful drone arsenal means that anyone not in the largest and latest battleships will regret ever locking horns with it.|81
648|28|Badger|The Badger-class freighter is the main cargo-carrier for the Caldari State, particularly in long, arduous trade-runs. Its huge size and comfortable armament makes it perfectly equipped for those tasks, although the Caldari seldom let it roam alone.   Caldari Industrial Skill Bonus: 5% Bonus Cargo Capacity and Max Velocity per skill level |84
649|28|Badger Mark II|The Badger Mark II is the latest version of the famous Badger, it's mostly used by the military or the mega corps for transports of goods of great value.

651|28|Hoarder|The Hoarder is the second in line of the Minmatar industrial ships, it's not as strong as the Mammoth but its cargo space is very large for its price. It's perfect for operation in peaceful areas or when it has strong escort.   Minmatar Industrial Skill Bonus: 5% Bonus Cargo Capacity and Max Velocity per skill level |82
652|28|Mammoth|The Mammoth is the biggest and the strongest industrial ship of the Minmatar Republic. It was designed with aid from the Gallente Federation, making the Mammoth both large and powerful yet also nimble and technologically advanced. A very good buy.   Minmatar Industrial Skill Bonus: 5% Bonus Cargo Capacity and Max Velocity per skill level |82
653|28|Wreathe|The Wreathe is an old ship of the Minmatar Republic and one of the oldest ships still in usage.

The recent discovery of the uncharted Sleeper Territories and their myriad wormholes has brought the Zephyr new attention - its mass makes it an ideal exploration vessel.  Valsas remains adamant that the Zephyr never sees mass production, but at the close of YC111 he authorized the Intaki Syndicate to distribute a single hull to every registered capsuleer.

3713|313|Vitoc|The Vitoc booster has become more than a simple strategy by the Amarrians in controling their slaves. With the Vitoc method, slaves are injected with a toxic chemical substance that is fatal unless the recipient receives a constant supply of an antidote. The method first appeared a few centuries ago when the Amarrians started manning some of their space ships with slaves. As space crew the slaves had to be cajoled into doing complex, often independent work, making older methods of slave control undesirable. Although the more conventional ways of subduing slaves with force (actual or threat of) are still widely used in other forced labor areas, the Vitoc method has proven itself admirably for the fleet.|491

3723|283|Slaver Hound|The slaver hound is a native animal of Syrikos V and has been bred by the Amarrians from the time they first settled the planet more than a millennium ago. The favorable experience of employing the slaver hound as a guard animal has led to it being exported from Syrikos V to most other Amarrian agricultural planets and even some industrial and mining ones as well. In recent years, the slaver hound has become fashionable among Amarrians as a pet for those willing to risk its often murderous nature; slaver hounds can become extremely loyal and devoted to their owners if handled with care. |23

4005|27|Scorpion Ishukone Watch|With its focus on electronic warfare, few ships can resist the direct onslaught of the Ishukone Watch Scorpion-class battleship's jamming capabilities.   <font color=white><u>Traits</u></font> 15% bonus to ECM Target Jammer strength per level 25% bonus to ECM Target Jammer optimal and falloff range per level 25% Bonus to ECM Burst range per level  <font color=white><u>Details</u></font> This variant of the Scorpion represents the pinnacle of the Ishukone paramilitary force's electronic warfare capabilities.  <font color=white><u>Development</u></font> When Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.  <font color=white><u>Technology</u></font> Though the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special LADAR and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.  <font color=white><u>Notes</u></font> Many wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an "incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority."|1620

4292|515|Siege Module II|An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a dreadnought's siege warfare abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the siege module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its offensive and defensive capabilities.  This results in a tremendous increase in damage, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Due to the ionic field created by the siege module, remote effects like warp scrambling et al. will not affect the ship while in siege mode.  This also means that friendly remote effects will not work while in siege mode either. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship nor are you allowed to dock until out of siege mode.  Note: A siege module requires Strontium clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one siege module can fitted to a dreadnought class ship. The amount of shield boosting gained from the Siege Module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other similar modules that affect the same attribute on the ship.|801
4294|515|Triage Module II|An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a carrier's defenses and logistical abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the triage module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its defensive and logistical capabilities.  This results in a great increase in the carrier's ability to provide aid to members of its fleet, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Due to the ionic flux created by the triage module, remote effects like warp scrambling et al. will not affect the ship while in triage mode.  This also means that friendly remote effects will not work while in triage mode either. The flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the carrier can still provide aid to its cohorts. Sensor strength and targeting capabilities are also significantly boosted. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship, nor is the carrier able to dock until out of triage mode. Finally, any drones or fighters currently in space will be abandoned when the module is activated.  Note: A triage module requires Strontium Clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one triage module can be run at any given time, so fitting more than one has no practical use. The remote repair module bonuses are only applied to capital sized modules. The amount of shield boosting gained from the Triage Module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other similar modules that affect the same attribute on the ship.  This module can only be fit on Carriers.|801

To this end, the ship has been made more agile, given a faster warp engine and fitted with an upgraded cargohold that can carry vast amounts of Quafe. In addition, its controls have been simplified so that new pilots can more easily meet the strict delivery conditions of prospective buyers.  While the Quafe Corporation has firmly denied making any alterations to its lucrative formula, and insists that the Iteron Mark IV Quafe Ultramarine Edition does not have special dispensation to carry a supercaffeinated version of the famous drink, it is notable that this model has been fitted with extra security mechanisms to prevent any and all crew from sampling its cargo.   While there are persistent rumors of storage crew personnel tasting the cargo and subsequently staying awake for days on end, grinding their teeth and yelling at each other, these have never been conclusively proven, although the Quafe Corporation does reportedly undertake all medical costs for any crewmember serving more than 72 consecutive hours onboard the Iteron Mark IV Quafe Ultramarine Edition.

Developer: Creodron   The Helios is Creodron's answer to the Ishukone Buzzard. After the fall of Crielere, the once-cordial relations between the Gallente Federation and the Caldari state deteriorated rapidly and, for a while, it seemed as if war might be brewing. It was seen by certain high-ranking officers within the Gallente navy as being of vital importance to be able to match the Caldari's cloaking technology in an effort to maintain the balance of power.

Although well suited to a variety of situations, they really come into their own in skirmish and fleet encounters, particularly against larger ships. For anyone wanting to decentralize their fleet's electronic countermeasure capabilities and make them immeasurably harder to counter, few things will serve better than a squadron or two of these little vessels.  Developer: Duvolle Labs   Duvolle Labs manufactures sturdy ships with a good mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. Since the company is one of New Eden's foremost manufacturers of particle blasters, its ships tend to favor turrets and thus have somewhat higher power output than normal.  Gallente Frigate Skill Bonus: 7.5% bonus to remote sensor dampener effectiveness and 10% reduction in remote sensor dampener capacitor need per level  Electronic Attack Ships Skill Bonus: 10% bonus to warp disruptor range and 10% reduction in warp disruptor capacitor need per level|1068

This, along with superior maneuverability and speed, makes them very hard to target and track, particularly for high caliber turrets.   Developer: Kaalakiota  As befits one of the largest weapons manufacturers in the known world, Kaalakiota's ships are very combat focused. Favoring the traditional Caldari combat strategy, they are designed around a substantial number of weapons systems, especially missile launchers. However, they have rather weak armor and structure, relying more on shields for protection.  Caldari Frigate Skill Bonus: 10% bonus to Kinetic Missile damage per level  Interceptor Skill Bonus: 15% reduction in MicroWarpdrive signature radius penalty and 10% bonus to Missile Velocity per level  Role bonus: 80% reduction in Propulsion Jamming systems activation cost|401

11182|830|Cheetah|Name: Cheetah Hull: Probe Class Role: Covert Ops Frigate  Designed for commando and espionage operation, its main strength is the ability to travel unseen through enemy territory and to avoid unfavorable encounters.  Developer: Thukker Mix  It is unclear how Thukker Mix could master the intricacies of cloaking technology so quickly after the fall of Crielere. According to Professor Oggand Viftuin, head of R&D, the tribe managed to recruit some senior Caldari scientist that used to work on the Mirage Project at Crielere. Ishukone has denied this, claiming that the Thukkers aquired the technology from prototypes stolen by the Guristas.

Developer: Carthum Conglomerate  Carthum ships are the very embodiment of the Amarrian warfare philosophy. Possessing sturdy armor and advanced weapon systems, they provide a nice mix of offense and defense. On the other hand, their electronic and shield systems tend to be rather limited.      Amarr Frigate Skill Bonus: 10% reduction in Small Energy Turret capacitor use and 5% bonus to Small Energy Turret damage per level  Interceptor Skill Bonus: 15% reduction in MicroWarpdrive signature radius penalty and 7.5% bonus to Small Energy Turret Tracking Speed per level    Role bonus: 80% reduction in Propulsion Jamming systems activation cost|400

Developer: Khanid Innovations   In addition to robust electronics systems, the Khanid Kingdom's ships possess advanced armor alloys capable of withstanding a great deal of punishment. Generally eschewing the use of turrets, they tend to gear their vessels more towards close-range missile combat.  Amarr Frigate Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to rocket damage and 4% bonus to armor resistances per level  Interceptor Skill Bonus: 15% reduction in MicroWarpdrive signature radius penalty and 5% bonus to Warp Scrambler and Warp Disruptor range per level  Role bonus: 80% reduction in Propulsion Jamming systems activation cost|400

Minmatar Frigate Skill Bonus: 5% increase to MicroWarpdrive capacitor bonus and 10% bonus to effectiveness of target painters per level  Electronic Attack Ships Skill Bonus: 20% bonus to stasis webifier range and 3% reduction in signature radius per level|1069
11393|324|Retribution|Name: Retribution Hull: Punisher Class Role: Assault Frigate  The Retribution is an homage to the glory days of the Empire, informed by classical Amarrian design philosophy: if it's strong, sturdy and packs a punch, it's ready for action.  What this powerhouse lacks in speed and maneuverability it more than makes up for with its wide range of firepower possibilities and superb defensive ability.  Developer:  Carthum Conglomerate  Carthum ships are the very embodiment of the Amarrian warfare philosophy. Possessing sturdy armor and advanced weapon system they provide a nice mix of offense and defense.

11399|18|Morphite|Morphite is a highly unorthodox mineral that can only be found in the hard-to-get Mercoxit ore. It is hard to use Morphite as a basic building material, but when it is joined with existing structures it can enhance the performance and durability manifold. This astounding quality makes this the material responsible for ushering in a new age in technology breakthroughs. |18
11400|324|Jaguar|Name: Jaguar Hull: Rifter Class Role: Assault Frigate  The Jaguar is a versatile ship capable of reaching speeds unmatched by any other assault-class vessel. While comparatively weak on the defensive front it sports great flexibility, allowing pilots considerable latitude in configuring their loadouts for whatever circumstances they find themselves in.  Developer:  Thukker Mix  Being the brain-child of the nomadic Thukkers, it is no surprise the Jaguar is as fast as it is.  Initially conceived as a way for the tribe to pack some added punch to their organized detachments, they've found it to be equally useful as messenger, scout and escort, and it is likely to become one of the most commonly-seen ships in the Thukkers' stomping grounds.

12836|1040|Transcranial Microcontrollers|The Transcranial Microcontroller was originally developed by the School of Applied Knowledge with funds from several humanitarian organizations to help catatonics regain consciousness and resume their lives, though in a limited capacity. The microcontroller, which can be used both in humans and machines, proved to be a great success and the Ishukone corporation stepped in and bought the rights to the chip several months ago. Since then, further studies by Ishukone technicians have revealed several additional ways the microcontroller can be used, such as control mechanisms in robots for industrial usage. Experts claim that the microchip does not offer higher efficiency in the robots compared to already established methods due to its reliance of a biomechanical host system. |1336

12995|314|Ultra! Promotional holoreel|This holoreel is a promotional reel from Quafe Corp, produced to advertise QuafeUltra. The reel has been universally panned by critics for what is perceived by many as intensely lurid subject matter.  One scene that's caused an uproar among various fundamentalist factions involves two of the main characters, Amarr girl Nadira and Brutor male Okar, engaging in a bout of severely salty reparte immediately followed by quite obviously-hinted-at sexual activity.  In another, the Gallente protagonist, a comely young female, enjoys a sultry dance with two other girls, culminating in a show of half-naked flesh that sent mothers everywhere lunging for their children's eyes.  Mentions and displays of Quafe Ultra during the reel's 89-minute running time number around 110, resulting in an average of 1.23 not-so-hidden advertisements per minute of the film's running time - another reason, critics say, to throw this reel into the jettison canister where it belongs. |492

13918|314|Korranis DNA|Once a member of the elite ranks within the Mordu's Legion Command, Korrani was a popular role model for young and aspiring pilots within the mercenary organization. Because of this it was even more surprising that such a talented and well known fighter pilot would be caught up in a murder trial ... of his own brother, who stood to inherit most of the real estate empire previously in possession of his Caldari grandfather. Korranis tale, although sad, is currently used by mentors within the Mordus Legion to teach new recruits a valuable lesson on life. But meanwhile, Korrani has made quite a name for himself within the underworld, choosing to live the life of a rogue freelancer rather than face trial in his nation of birth for murder. Korrani operates a powerfull Mordu ship fitted with top notch equipment, a worthy adversary for any decent fighter pilot. |752

20280|515|Siege Module I|An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a dreadnought's siege warfare abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the siege module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its offensive and defensive capabilities.  This results in a tremendous increase in damage, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Due to the ionic field created by the siege module, remote effects like warp scrambling et al. will not affect the ship while in siege mode.  This also means that friendly remote effects will not work while in siege mode either. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship nor are you allowed to dock until out of siege mode.  Note: A siege module requires Strontium clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one siege module can fitted to a dreadnought class ship. The amount of shield boosting gained from the Siege Module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other similar modules that affect the same attribute on the ship.|801

23915|547|Chimera|The Chimera's design is based upon the Kairiola, a vessel holding tremendous historical significance for the Caldari.  Initially a water freighter, the Kairiola was refitted in the days of the Gallente-Caldari war to act as a fighter carrier during the orbital bombardment of Caldari Prime.   It was most famously flown by the legendary Admiral Yakia Tovil-Toba directly into Gallente Prime's atmosphere, where it fragmented and struck several key locations on the planet.  This event, where the good Admiral gave his life, marked the culmination of a week's concentrated campaign of distraction which enabled the Caldari to evacuate their people from their besieged home planet.  Where the Chimera roams, the Caldari remember.  Caldari Carrier Skill Bonuses: 50% bonus to Capital Energy and Shield transfer range per level 4% bonus to all Shield resistances per level Can fit Warfare Link modules Can fit Tactical Logistics Reconfiguration modules Can deploy 1 additional Fighter or Drone per level 200% bonus to Fighter control range|819

According to historical sources the ship was traditionally taken on parade runs between the continent of Tikiona and the Muriyuke archipelago, seat of the Emperor, and represented the pride and joy of what would one day become the Caldari State.  Today's starfaring version gives no ground to its legendary predecessor; with its varied applications in the vast arena of deep space, the Wyvern is likely to stand as a symbol of Caldari greatness for untold years to come.  Note: This ship class is capable of carrying only fighters and fighter bombers in its drone bay.  Caldari Carrier Skill Bonuses: 50% bonus to Capital Energy and Shield transfer range per level 4% bonus to all Shield resistances per level Can fit Projected Electronic Counter Measures Can deploy 3 additional Fighters or Fighter Bombers per level Can fit 1 additional Warfare Link module per level 200% bonus to Fighter or Fighter Bomber control range Immune to all forms of Electronic Warfare |819

25266|737|Gas Cloud Harvester I|The core technology employed by Gas Harvesters dates back centuries, to a time when the extraction of material in space was still a growing industry. Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic conversions used by today's Gas Harvesters as a promising new method for extracting spacebound ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.  When the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time, Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries and economies in the process. |1037

25812|737|Gas Cloud Harvester II|The core technology employed by Gas Harvesters dates back centuries, to a time when the extraction of material in space was still a growing industry. Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic conversions used by today's Gas Harvesters as a promising new method for extracting spacebound ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.  When the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time, Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries and economies in the process.   Research interest picked back up in Gas Harvesting technology when new, stable wormholes began proliferating across the cluster. As soon as the wormholes were discovered, so too, were the giant gas clouds pockets within the unknown systems they linked to. In a single day, the demand for Tech II Gas Cloud Harvester exploded. Research projects were hastily established and grants hurriedly thrown out to the most promising firms pursuing a redesign. It was only a few days before a breakthrough was made, and all the harvesting technology that had come before was quickly relegated to second place. |1037

27951|515|Triage Module I|An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a carrier's defenses and logistical abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the triage module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its defensive and logistical capabilities.  This results in a great increase in the carrier's ability to provide aid to members of its fleet, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Due to the ionic flux created by the triage module, remote effects like warp scrambling et al. will not affect the ship while in triage mode.  This also means that friendly remote effects will not work while in triage mode either. The flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the carrier can still provide aid to its cohorts. Sensor strength and targeting capabilities are also significantly boosted. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship, nor is the carrier able to dock until out of triage mode. Finally, any drones or fighters currently in space will be abandoned when the module is activated.  Note: A triage module requires Strontium Clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one triage module can be run at any given time, so fitting more than one has no practical use. The remote repair module bonuses are only applied to capital sized modules. The amount of shield boosting gained from the Triage Module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other similar modules that affect the same attribute on the ship.  This module can only be fit on Carriers.|801

28352|883|Rorqual|The Rorqual was conceived and designed by Outer Ring Excavations in response to a growing need for capital industry platforms with the ability to support and sustain large-scale mining operations in uninhabited areas of space.  To that end, the Rorqual's primary strength lies in its ability to grind raw ores into particles of smaller size than possible before, while still maintaining their distinctive molecular structure. This means the vessel is able to carry vast amounts of ore in compressed form.  Additionally, the Rorqual is able to fit a capital tractor beam unit, capable of pulling in cargo containers from far greater distances and at far greater speeds than smaller beams can. It also possesses a sizeable drone bay, jump drive capability and the capacity to fit a clone vat bay. This combination of elements makes the Rorqual the ideal nexus to build deep space mining operations around.  Due to its specialization towards industrial operations, its ship maintenance bay is able to accommodate only industrial ships, mining barges and their tech 2 variants  Capital Industrial Ships skill bonuses: -5% reduction in fuel consumption for industrial cores per level 10% bonus to effectiveness of mining foreman links per level when in deployed mode 50% bonus to the range of Capital Shield Transporters per level. 20% bonus to drone damage and hitpoints per level.  Role Bonuses:  900% bonus to the range of survey scanners 200% bonus to the range of cargo scanners  Can fit Clone Vat Bay Can use 3 Warfare Link modules simultaneously.|1048

28680|303|Synth Mindflood Booster|This booster relaxant allows the pilot to control his ship more instinctively and expend less energy in doing so. This in turn lets the ship utilize more of its resources for mechanical functions, most notably its capacitor, rather than constantly having to compensate for the usual exaggerated motions of a stressed pilot.|977
28682|303|Synth X-Instinct Booster|This energizing booster grants its user a vastly improved economy of effort when parsing the data streams needed to sustain space flight. The main benefit of this lie not in improved performance but less waste of transmission and extraneous micromaneuvers, making the pilot's ship sleeker in performance and harder to detect. The booster's only major drawback is the crazed notion that the pilot's inventory would look so much better if merely rearranged ONE MORE TIME.|977
28684|303|Synth Sooth Sayer Booster|This booster induces a trancelike state whereupon the pilot is able to sense the movement of faraway items without all the usual static flooding the senses. Being in a trance helps the pilot hit those moving items with better accuracy, although he has to be careful not to start hallucinating.|977

28844|902|Rhea|Name: Rhea Hull: Charon Role: Jump Freighter  It wasn't long after the Thukkers began deploying their jump capable freighters that other corporations saw the inherent tactical value of such ships.  After extended negotiations, Ishukone finally closed a deal exchanging undisclosed technical data for the core innovations underpinning the original Thukker Tribes design allowing them to rapidly bring to the market the largest jump capable freighter of them all, the Rhea, a true behemoth of the stars.  Developer : Ishukone  Ishukone, always striving to be ahead of the competition, have proved themselves to be one of the most adept starship designers in the State.  A surprising majority of the Caldari Fleets ships of the line were created by their designers.  Respected and feared by their peers Ishukone remain amongst the very top of the Caldari corporate machine.

28846|902|Nomad|Name: Nomad Hull: Fenrir Role: Jump Freighter  There is continuing speculation as to how exactly the Thukkers manage to move their vast caravans throughout space relatively undetected, but their expertise with jump drive technology became glaringly apparent when they created the Nomad.  Now seeing widespread service with roving Thukker outrider detachments, the Nomad is rapidly becoming an essential part of Thukker life away from the great caravans.  Developer : Thukker Mix  Thukkers spend their entire lives forever wandering the infinite in their vast caravans.  As such their technology is based as much upon necessity as their ingenious ability to tinker.  Their ship designs therefore tend to based upon the standard empire templates but extensively modified for the Thukkers unique needs.

The Anshar's specially-developed cargo-manipulation drones allowed Creodron to optimize their loading algorithms and fully utilize every nook and cranny of the ship's spacious interior, ensuring it more than holds its own amongst its peers.    Developer : CreoDron  As the largest drone developer and manufacturer in space, CreoDron has a vested interest in drone carriers but has recently began to expand their design focus and employ drone techniques on whole other levels which has lead some to question where this leap in technology came from.

Krusual elders whisper ancient tales among their huddled tribes, describing the glory of heroes past and enigmatic prophecies of old. On the darkest day, at the most hopeless moments, an elder may speak of <i>loki</i>, in reverent tones and excited hushes. In the ancient tongue, the <i>loki</i> are the crux of Krusual thought. There is no direct translation for this word; in fact, <i>loki</i> translates differently among the elders. It can mean hidden wonder or secret passage, changing mask or unseen dagger.

29992|964|Optimized Nano-engines|Forming the beating heart of the Sleeper's automated drones, these tiny engines count in the billions. When fully intact, they deliver levels of power efficiency unrivalled by current technology. Unfortunately, whenever a Sleeper drone is destroyed, these engines are the first to go with them, making it difficult to emulate their functionality without the addition of other materials.   To recreate a functional nanoengine housing, PPD fullerene fibers are combined with metallofullerenes and fullerene fiber conduits to rebuild the basic structures that once housed them. After that, the fused nanomechanical engines are connected to one another, forming a composite whole.   Although mechanical engineers have theorized about this construction method for many decades, the process was always held back by a lack of fullerene material. It is said that only hours after the discovery of fullerite clouds in wormhole space, the empires used significant amounts of their fullerene stockpiles to produce these engines. The reasoning behind this is simply the staggering breadth of potential applications these engines have. When it comes to engineering, there isn't much they can't do.|1147

29994|964|Warfare Computation Core|Warfare computation cores begin as basic microprocessors that handle the flow of data between various combat analyzers, prioritizing vital information and calculations. The cores are first built around salvaged Sleeper warfare processors which are then further enhanced by the integration of fullerene polymers and other Sleeper technology. The addition of emergent combat analyzers expands the functionality to include more abstract combat calculations, such as comparative analyses of fleets and predictive IFF identifications.   When encased in thermophased metallofullerene plating, the cores can be embedded directly into the ship's hull. This allows for a far more efficient production method of Tech III vessels, enabling any subsystem variation to integrate into a hull without the need for further redesign in the combat electronics systems. |1147

29996|964|Emergent Neurovisual Interface|As a capsuleer, few things are more important in space flight than the ability to instantly gauge one's surroundings and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, capsules inside starships make frequent use of neurovisual reproductions; emulations that recreate external stimuli using the most low-latency processor available  the human brain. This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After capturing the data, they then feed it directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously. Functions familiar to any capsuleer such as the overview, tactical overlay and hostile threat indicators are just a few examples of the device's capabilities.   Although NVI technology has been around since the inception of the capsule, the addition of salvaged Sleeper drone components and the now widely available fullerene polymers has carried the functionality forward into the new Tech III paradigm. Even before the first Strategic Cruiser was built, engineers hypothesized about potential issues with an NVI trying to communicate with an almost limitless combination of subsystems. Fortunately, the solution to the problem came wrapped up in the same technology that moved Tech III vessels from the world of scientific theory into reality.|1147

30002|964|Fullerene Intercalated Sheets|The manufacture of this component requires the rarest and most valuable technology salvageable from Sleeper drones. These sheets represent some of the most advanced composite materials known to New Eden. When other, more valuable devices are embedded into the structure at the molecular level, the sheets' performance enhances tremendously. The end result is a component with an almost endless number of applications in starship design.   Ultra-resilient armor plating, defensive nanoassemblers, electronics housing, and even the molecular-level circuitry itself are only a few of the near-countless roles that fullerene intercalated sheets can perform. Although unrivalled in their modularity, the cost of construction remains a barrier on supply; consequently, they remain a component to be used only when absolutely necessary.   Scientists and engineers alike claim that a steadier supply of these rare Sleeper pieces would instantly advance starship design ten years. Other experts have made even more interesting claims, stating that the staggering utility of the components suggests a level of technological advancement sufficient for capsule production.|1147

From there, fulleroferrocene and graphene nanoribbons are integrated into the metals, forming alloys that have unprecedented levels of structural strength. Although they have many uses in the manufacture of armor plating, the distinguishing feature of the alloys is the level of modularity they allow in starship design.

30036|955|Legion Electronics - Energy Parasitic Complex|During some of the first conflicts with them, Amarr engineers noticed a remarkable feature in Sleeper drone technology: the ability of drones to transfer power between one another without the need for specialized equipment. This technology seemed to be innate to every drone in some capacity, and while the engineers could not reproduce this system in modern space vessels, they were able to adapt the technology into modular Tech III designs. The energy parasitic complex turns the Sleeper tech on its head, changing the energy transfer from a symbiotic function to a vampiric one by providing a boost to energy neutralizer and energy vampire equipment.

30042|955|Legion Electronics - Emergent Locus Analyzer|Emboldened by the development of other, more specialized subsystems, engineers and astrophysicists alike began to investigate modifications to a Strategic Cruiser that could aid their fellow scientists and explorers. The first reverse-engineering projects were predominantly focused on ways to improve a vessel's astrometrics capabilities. The two-pronged solution of boosting both the strength of the launchers and the probes they deployed proved to be the most popular design in the end. It was not long after the first designs were sold that others took notice and began to reverse-engineer their own. Soon enough, the subsystem was catapulted into mainstream Tech III subsystem manufacture, although perhaps for more than just that one reason.    The first designers of the emergent locus analyzer noted an additional  and entirely unintended  effect in tractor beams. Not only did they reach further, but they would also pull in their cargo more quickly than normal tractor beams. It was an unexpected by-product of the processes that increased scan probe strength, but far from an undesirable one. Although it is not fully clear what part of the construction process enables this additional benefit, so long as the subsystem is built in that exact fashion, it will continue to provide it.

The two-pronged solution of boosting both the strength of the launchers and the probes they deployed proved to be the most popular design in the end. It was not long after the first designs were sold that others took notice and began to reverse-engineer their own. Soon enough, the subsystem was catapulted into mainstream Tech III subsystem manufacture, although perhaps for more than just that one reason.    The first designers of the emergent locus analyzer noted an additional  and entirely unintended  effect in tractor beams. Not only did they reach further, but they would also pull in their cargo more quickly than normal tractor beams. It was an unexpected by-product of the processes that increased scan probe strength, but far from an undesirable one. Although it is not fully clear what part of the construction process enables this additional benefit, so long as the subsystem is built in that exact fashion, it will continue to provide it.    Subsystem Skill Bonus: 10% increase to scan strength of probes per level. 20% bonus to range and velocity of tractor beams per level. +10 Virus Strength to Relic and Data Analyzers  Role Bonus: -99% reduced CPU need for Scan Probe Launchers.|1630
30056|955|Proteus Electronics - Friction Extension Processor|The friction extension processor capitalizes on recent advances made in fullerene-based component development. The system works on a similar design to interdiction spheres by expanding a ship's warp interdiction range. The technology behind it has existed in theory for some years, dating back to when engineers first began development of Heavy Interdiction Cruisers. They noticed an increased efficiency in the electronic disruption of fullerene molecules when combined with the static disruption energies of the spheres. When more fullerene-based materials suddenly became available, it was only a matter of further testing before theory became reality.   Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to warp disruptor and warp scrambler range per level.|1628
30058|955|Proteus Electronics - CPU Efficiency Gate|New technologies have resulted in a noticeable increase in CPU efficiency, as better nanotech enables further miniaturization of circuits, the result of which is a marked decrease in system bottlenecking. This CPU efficiency gate capitalizes on that technology, offering a pilot greater CPU output.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  5% bonus to CPU per level|1628
30060|955|Proteus Electronics - Dissolution Sequencer|This subsystems employs a nano-electromechanical dispersion field to strengthen a vessel's sensor systems.

30066|955|Loki Electronics - Immobility Drivers|Even millennia old, the technology employed by Sleeper drones is far from lacking. This is particularly true in the field of interdiction technology, where their capabilities often exceed contemporary systems. Consequently, this aspect of their fearsome arsenal has been the focus of much study and in some rare cases, the starting point for scientific breakthroughs. Minmatar researchers studied the long-range webification systems of the Sleeper drones from the moment they were discovered, quickly reverse engineering a subsystem for their Loki that could replicate the Sleeper's own offensive modules. The end result is a noticeable amplification of a stasis webifier's effective range.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  30% bonus to stasis webifier range per level|1629
30068|955|Loki Electronics - Tactical Targeting Network|Many engineers have attempted to reproduce the precision of the Sleeper drones' weapon systems, but with very few results. The closest reproduction achieved thus far is this targeting network, a complex system of neurovisual interlays, automated trigger response units, and microscanning resolution ordinances. The combination of these processes produces a bonus to scan resolution, easing the targeting of enemies in space.<br> <br> Subsystem Skill Bonus: <br> 15% bonus to scan resolution per level|1629

30076|957|Legion Propulsion - Chassis Optimization|This subsystem exploits the latest technological advances afforded by discovery of the ancient Sleeper race's own designs. Optimizations made to the chassis allow for vast improvements to be made to a Legion's base velocity. Although the various layout optimizations sacrifice other options for propulsion customization, the flow-on effects from an increase in base velocity make it an attractive upgrade for those whose Tech III vessels are in need of an overall speed increase.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  5% bonus to max velocity per level.|1134
30078|957|Legion Propulsion - Fuel Catalyst|The ancient Sleeper race was known to have mastered various sustainable energy technologies including thermoelectric systems, which they usually built directly into a vessel's hull. Capsuleer reverse-engineers took little time to adapt salvaged versions of these Sleeper energy systems into their own modular Tech III vessel pieces.   Thanks to widespread demand in the Amarrian transport industry, fuel catalyst systems were one of the first to be developed for the Empire. Making full use of locally generated thermoelectric power, they are able to supplement the fuel needs of an afterburner. This process makes it possible to inject fuel in larger amounts for the same capacitor cost, offering pilots a significant boost to the velocity increase from afterburners.   Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to afterburner speed per level.|1134
30080|957|Legion Propulsion - Wake Limiter|This subsystem limits the wake left behind by a starship's microwarpdrive, allowing a pilot to maintain a lowered signature radius while still moving at high speed. The underlying design is based on the same technology used by smaller Sleeper drones and empire-produced Interceptors. Although the engineering processes behind wake limiters have existed for quite some time in the empires, their application in modular subsystems has only become a possibility after fullerene polymers became more widely available.   Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% reduction in microwarpdrive signature radius penalty per level.|1134
30082|957|Legion Propulsion - Interdiction Nullifier|Dubbed the interdiction nullifier by the Guristas, who suffered its first introduction on the battlefield, this subsystem grants a startling and unprecedented capability; an immunity to non-targeted interdiction such as mobile warp disruptors and interdiction spheres.   The origins of the first nullifier designs are shrouded in mystery, but the subsystem's initial production of is thought to have taken place soon after the wormhole openings, and well before the technology became widespread knowledge. Not long after the first Tengu were designed, the Caldari Navy intercepted emergency transmissions from Guristas fleets across Venal, Tenal and Vale of the Silent. All of the reports made mention of Loki-class vessels slipping past defensive deployments and into core Guristas territory despite all efforts to stop the ships or slow them down.    Following these reports, rumors spread that other groups began to discover and implement this extraordinary new technology, and yet of all the factions that leapt upon the opportunity, none were so eager or ruthless in their own race to capitalize as the independent capsuleer and pirate organizations that make the nullsec frontiers their home.    Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% increased agility per level  Role Bonus: Immunity to non-targeted interdiction|1134
30086|957|Tengu Propulsion - Intercalated Nanofibers|Constructed from hard yet lightweight fullerene polymers, these intercalated fibers boost the agility of a starship without compromising its structural resilience. Even though basic nanofibers have existed for hundreds of years, the integration of various Sleeper-based salvage and other polymers takes the technology to a completely new level of modularity. This has allowed the same centuries-old technology to be ported over to the new Tech III paradigm.   Subsystem Skill Bonus:  5% increased agility per level.|1135
30088|957|Tengu Propulsion - Gravitational Capacitor|This subsystem lowers the capacitor cost of warping and increases actual warp speed. With the influx of fullerene-based polymers and the discovery of Sleeper drone technology, the same fundamental principles once only sparingly employed in advance scout vessels such as Covert Ops and Interceptors could be re-applied to modular Tech III vessels. The Caldari are said to have been the first empire to benefit from reverse-engineering attempts aimed at producing these subsystems, something which the Gallente Federation's own scientists flatly deny.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  15% bonus to warp speed per level 15% reduction in capacitor need when initiating warp per level|1135

Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% reduction in microwarpdrive signature radius penalty per level.|1136
30098|957|Proteus Propulsion - Localized Injectors|This subsystem uses molecular-level nanotubes to increase the combustive efficiency of afterburners. Fuel is injected locally in a far more effective and controllable manner, thereby reducing the draw on the capacitor system. Although the decrease in capacitor use is relatively modest, even minute enhancements at this level can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  15% reduction in afterburner and microwarpdrive capacitor consumption per level|1136
30100|957|Proteus Propulsion - Gravitational Capacitor|This subsystem lowers the capacitor cost of warping and increases actual warp speed. With the influx of fullerene-based polymers and the discovery of Sleeper drone technology, the same fundamental principles once only sparingly employed in advance scout vessels such as Covert Ops and Interceptors could be re-applied to modular Tech III vessels. Although the Caldari claim to have been the first to successfully reverse-engineer these subsystems, the Federation argues that they were the first to deliver the breakthrough. Despite the contention, neither party seems keen to publicize the research data necessary to back their respective claims.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  15% bonus to warp speed per level 15% reduction in capacitor need when initiating warp per level|1136
30102|957|Proteus Propulsion - Interdiction Nullifier|Dubbed the interdiction nullifier by the Guristas, who suffered its first introduction on the battlefield, this subsystem grants a startling and unprecedented capability; an immunity to non-targeted interdiction such as mobile warp disruptors and interdiction spheres.

Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% increased agility per level  Role Bonus: Immunity to non-targeted interdiction|1137
30117|956|Legion Offensive - Drone Synthesis Projector|Sleeper drones, while completely devoid of modern shielding technology, are nonetheless sturdy, mainly due to their metallofullerene armor plating and hull composition. When drones are docked into this system, the projection system enhances their damage capabilities, both in absorbing and delivering damage, through the creation of a fullerene-based field around the drones.    Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to medium energy turret capacitor use per level 10% bonus to drone damage per level 7.5% bonus to drone hitpoints per level|1130
30118|956|Legion Offensive - Assault Optimization|Originally a laser-based weapons system, Amarrian starship engineers were forced to seek alternative construction methods when several fatal flaws were discovered in their design. Khanid Innovations was quick to offer a missile-based solution that benefitted greatly from their years of experience working on Sacrilege cruisers. The reapplication of their previously successful technology was so fast and effective that the more traditional Amarrian engineers could do little but watch as the knowledge and consequent implementation of these new engineering methodologies proliferated across the cluster.   Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to heavy assault missile damage per level 5% bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level|1130
30119|956|Legion Offensive - Liquid Crystal Magnifiers|One of the many gems discovered amidst Sleeper technology was the creation of more efficient liquid crystal lenses. Amarr researchers have engineered these lenses to increase a laser's focus for longer stretches, both in distance and in timing, allowing a laser to reach farther targets with more efficiency of energy output. Additionally, the fullerene-infused lenses can generate higher temperatures and stronger, more damaging beams and pulses.   Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to medium energy turret capacitor use per level  10% bonus to medium energy turret damage per level 10% bonus to medium energy turret optimal range per level|1130
30120|956|Legion Offensive - Covert Reconfiguration|From the moment Strategic Cruisers became a reality, there were whispers amongst the scientific community about the potential for advances in cloaking technology. They remained that alone for the longest time, with few involved in the reverse-engineering process willing to share any news of their discoveries. Everyone knew that, should the technology ever become a reality, the capabilities of the new Strategic Cruisers would change overnight.  The Amarrians are suspected to have developed cloaking technology for the Legion around the same time as the first capsuleer designs began to surface. For almost a full week, Minmatar rebel camps deep inside Heimatar and Metropolis were subjected to ruthless guerilla attacks, almost unprecedented in their ferocity and viciousness.  Although initially confused by such a marked changed in their opponent's warfare philosophy, the Matari knew that each target had been a high profile objective for the Amarr Navy, and noted with deep suspicion how all of the squads had been spearheaded by Legions that could hit and fade with alarming ease. Few doubted who was behind the bloodshed. The Amarrians remained silent for the most part, the only official statement; that God's will had manifested itself in the heart of evil.   Subsystem Skill Bonus: 10% bonus to medium energy turret capacitor use per level  Role Bonus: 100% reduction in Cloaking Device CPU use  Notes: Can fit covert ops cloaks and covert cynosural field generators. Cloak reactivation delay reduced to 5 seconds.|1130
30122|956|Tengu Offensive - Accelerated Ejection Bay|This missile launcher system was formed not from the missile bays of Sleeper drones, but from the direct-fire turrets and hardpoints salvaged from them instead. Adapting the underlying technology behind the drones' rapid-firing turrets for their own missile systems, Caldari engineers have managed to revolutionize modular launching mechanisms, improving launch speed and kinetic warhead payloads.   Subsystem Skill Bonus:  5% bonus to Kinetic Missile Damage per level 7.5% bonus to Heavy, Heavy Assault and Rapid Light missile launcher rate of fire per level 10% bonus to Heavy Missile and Heavy Assault missile velocity per level|1131
30123|956|Tengu Offensive - Rifling Launcher Pattern|An odd bit of technology garnered from the Sleepers is missile rifling, a method adapted from more primitive projectile technology. The launcher bays in this missile pattern contain long, microscopic grooves that spiral through the launcher and can fit any known missile shape. Once the missile is launched, these grooves give additional velocity and accuracy to the missile. Additionally, the shallow cuts contain wiring that enhances the missile's guidance system, creating another conduit for communication between ship, missile, and target.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to ECM target jammer strength per level 5% bonus to Heavy Assault Launcher, Heavy Missile Launcher and Rapid Light Missile Launcher Rate of Fire per level|1131
30124|956|Tengu Offensive - Magnetic Infusion Basin|This subsystem serves as a specialized storage bin for a ship's hybrid ammo. The basin, however, also serves as a cyclotron, infusing the ammo with magnetic energy immediately before it is injected into the turret. The amplified ammo has an increased range and damage potential.   Subsystem Skill Bonus:  5% bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level 20% bonus to medium hybrid turret optimal range per level|1131
30125|956|Tengu Offensive - Covert Reconfiguration|From the moment Strategic Cruisers became a reality, there were whispers amongst the scientific community about the potential for advances in cloaking technology. They remained that alone for the longest time, with few involved in the reverse engineering process willing to share any news of their discoveries. Everyone knew that, should the technology ever become a reality, the capabilities of the new Strategic Cruisers would change overnight.  When some of the State's first cloaking subsystems were unveiled at a secure Caldari military complex, those select few spectators did not understand for a moment, the reason behind the comparatively underwhelming offense. When the first Tengu broke from its attack and vanished in front of hundreds of onlookers  not only from the field of battle, but from the system itself  the reasons behind a conservative weapons design suddenly became clear.   Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level  Role Bonus: 100% reduction in Cloaking Device CPU use  Notes: Can fit covert ops cloaks and covert cynosural field generators. Cloak reactivation delay reduced to 5 seconds.|1131
30127|956|Proteus Offensive - Dissonic Encoding Platform|A unique application of fullerene material can be found in this platform, where vibrations from the metallic plating  transfer from turret to hybrid charge. Discharged ammo immersed in this dissonic frequency maintains its shape and velocity pattern once launched towards a target. However, upon impact, the ammo undulates in an unstable fashion, transfering the frequency to its target and thereby causing more damage.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level 10% bonus to medium hybrid turret falloff per level 7.5% bonus to medium hybrid turret tracking per level|1132
30128|956|Proteus Offensive - Hybrid Propulsion Armature|This complex armature is composed of fullerene composites and based upon the understood weapons mechanics of salvaged Sleeper drones. Gallente researchers have fused this technology with the emerging theories on magnetic resonance and microwarp capabilities to power the kinetic energy systems of hybrid turrets. With these mechanics in place, the propulsion armature creates an effective distribution module for hybrid charges, bolstering their damage output and their falloff range.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level  10% bonus to medium hybrid turret falloff per level|1132
30129|956|Proteus Offensive - Drone Synthesis Projector|Sleeper drones, while completely devoid of modern shielding technology, are nonetheless sturdy, mainly due to their metallofullerene armor plating and hull composition. Most of these technological applications are for capsuleer vessels, but a few rogue Gallente firms have quietly created this bay for use with contemporary drones. When drones are docked into this system, the projection system enhances their damage capabilities, both in absorbing and delivering damage, through the creation of a fullerene-based field around the drones.    Subsystem Skill Bonus:  5% bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level  10% bonus to drone damage per level 7.5% bonus to drone hitpoints per level|1132
30130|956|Proteus Offensive - Covert Reconfiguration|From the moment Strategic Cruisers became a reality, there were whispers amongst the scientific community about the potential for advances in cloaking technology. They remained that alone for the longest time, with few involved in the reverse engineering process willing to share any news of their discoveries. Everyone knew that, should the technology ever become a reality, the capabilities of the new Strategic Cruisers would change overnight.  To many Gallente and Caldari, the development of the Proteus covert reconfiguration signaled a repeat of the technological arms race that arose from the ashes of Crielere. Once again seeking a balance of power, and entirely convinced that the Caldari were attempting to reverse-engineer their own cloak-capable Strategic Cruisers, the Federation diverted immense resources to their research. Private firms and the largest of conglomerates all played a role in development, offering up prototype designs and speculative theories that collectively resulted in some of the first Covert-Capable Proteus produced. It is not known who, or what organization led the project. Nor is known when, or where, the first Covert Reconfigurations were deployed. If it had not been for capsuleers developing the same designs, most people would have remained oblivious to their existence, just the way the Federation would have preferred.  Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level  Role Bonus: 100% reduction in Cloaking Device CPU use  Notes: Can fit covert ops cloaks and covert cynosural field generators. Cloak reactivation delay reduced to 5 seconds.|1132
30132|956|Loki Offensive - Turret Concurrence Registry|Increasing the tracking capabilities of projectile weaponry has never been an easy task, yet the introduction of Sleeper technology has made this job more achievable. This registry is based on the idea of concurrence, where firing mechanisms can recycle energy among multiple turret emissions. This recycled energy is not only sustainable, but more powerful as well, a marvel considering its normal power output relative to other turret systems. Projectile turrets can be modified to use this surplus power to not only augment projectile damage output, but also to make minute adjustments on the fly, offering increasing tracking speed and optimal range.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  10% bonus to medium projectile turret damage per level  10% bonus to medium projectile turret optimal range per level 7.5% bonus to medium projectile turret tracking per level|1133
30133|956|Loki Offensive - Projectile Scoping Array|Scoping arrays were mostly out of fashion in recent ship design, but Sleeper technology has brought them somewhat back into vogue. Based upon the remarkable flexibility fullerene-based technology, Sleeper-based scoping arrays allowed projectile weaponry to produce longer-ranged accuracy without reducing the weapon's rate-of-fire. While a resurgence of scoping arrays is not expected, this subsystem certainly shows its uses in modern warfare.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  7.5% bonus to medium projectile turret rate of fire per level 10% bonus to medium projectile falloff per level.|1133
30134|956|Loki Offensive - Hardpoint Efficiency Configuration|Adaptation and innovation go hand-in-hand, and this subsystem is a prime example of both ideas. While researching Sleeper drone weapon systems, a group of Minmatar engineers discovered special similarities to the technology behind all Sleeper weapon types. Distilling the underlying mechanic to its essence produced this hardpoint configuration, which enabled projectile weapons and missile launchers to share power sources and energy supplies (most of which were advanced beyond modern standards). This offers a vast increase to the rate of fire of both weapon types. Attempts to merge this technology to other weapon groups have, as yet, proven unsuccessful.  Subsystem Skill Bonus:  7.5% bonus to medium projectile turret rate of fire per level 7.5% bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level|1133
30135|956|Loki Offensive - Covert Reconfiguration|From the moment Strategic Cruisers became a reality, there were whispers amongst the scientific community about the potential for advances in cloaking technology. They remained that alone for the longest time, with few involved in the reverse engineering process willing to share any news of their discoveries. Everyone knew that, should the technology ever become a reality, the capabilities of the new Strategic Cruisers would change overnight.      The Loki's Covert Reconfiguration designs arose out of a collective will to respond to what was thought to be Amarrian aggression deep inside their home regions. Unlike many scientific and technological breakthroughs, it was not the Sebiestor tribe alone who ushered in the paradigm shift to covert-capable Strategic Cruisers. It was only through consultation and collaboration with many other tribes and sub-factions that something substantial began to take shape.   The Krusual and Thukker are said to have played the most important roles, however, in realizing the final design; the Thukker by providing the cloaking technology, and the Krusual by convincing them to do so. How they achieved this, or what they may have promised remains a secret; the two tribes are notorious for having many, and keeping them all.  Subsystem Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to medium projectile turret rate of fire per level  Role Bonus: 100% reduction in Cloaking Device CPU use  Notes: Can fit covert ops cloaks and covert cynosural field generators. Cloak reactivation delay reduced to 5 seconds.|1133
30139|958|Tengu Engineering - Power Core Multiplier|Comprised of countless nanomachines that enhance the energy flow from a ship's reactor core, this engineering subsystem offers a pilot the option of increasing the power grid of their vessel. Although the empires mastered energy grid upgrades many centuries ago, the adaptation of old designs to the new Tech III paradigm has been a more recent breakthrough.   Subsystem Skill Bonus:  5% bonus to power output per level.|1123
30141|958|Tengu Engineering - Augmented Capacitor Reservoir|Another example of an old technology re-worked to fit the new Tech III paradigm, augmented capacitor subsystems improve upon the size of a vessel's capacitor.

Even though empire-based designs have achieved this effect for centuries, the way in which this system works is markedly different.    Rather than the usual tweaking of capacitor fluid formulas, this design simply triples the number of nanotubes inside  something not possible until the recent influx of fullerene polymers from which this subsystem is made. This results in a drastic increase in the speed and efficiency of energy flow throughout a ship.

30151|958|Proteus Engineering - Augmented Capacitor Reservoir|Another example of an old technology re-worked to fit the new Tech III paradigm, augmented capacitor subsystems redirect large segments of the capacitor to power other modules.

Rather than the usual tweaking of capacitor fluid formulas, this design simply triples the number of nanotubes inside  something not possible until the recent influx of fullerene polymers from which this subsystem is made. The end result is a drastic increase in the speed and efficiency of energy flow throughout a ship, as well as a much larger surface area, which allows for above average capacitor size.

30187|971|Intact Thruster Sections|Even after millennia of exposure to space, these thruster sections show barely any signs of mechanical wear and appear to be completely functional. The modular design of Sleeper propulsion systems is similar to that of the empires, but deviates in a few interesting areas.   Pristine, working examples of Sleeper technology such as this are extremely rare and even more valuable. With the right skills and equipment, they can offer great insights into the scientific pursuits of the ancient race that designed them. |1149

30248|966|Emergent Combat Analyzer|This combat analyzer appears to use the same fundamental programming as standard Empire-issue technology, although it operates at a much higher level of efficiency. These devices are typically employed in fleets where they provide predictive analyses of complex battle scenarios and supplement other combat electronics that handle smaller elements.   Combat analyzers are best employed in tasks such as calculating a fleet's success rate, running comparative analyses between fleets and other similarly abstract problem-solving tasks requiring higher levels of heuristic programming. Even though the equipment has been badly damaged, the core functionality remains intact. With a skilled programmer and a talented mechanic, it could be re-integrated into a starship.|1148
30251|966|Neurovisual Input Matrix|Used in conjunction with other equipment inside the capsule, neurovisual input matrices serve the vital function of translating external stimuli into visual data. Ship identifier tags, hostile threat indicators and tactical overlay interfaces are all typical examples of N.I.M at work. The Sleeper variants of these matrices are not substantively different from contemporary devices, needing only a few supplemental components and some minor reprogramming before they can operate in much the same way. The only major deviation is in the energy efficiency. The Sleeper device is almost a thousand times less demanding on a ship's power core.|1148
30252|966|Thermoelectric Catalysts|These tiny nanomachines have been injected into the thermoelectric power core at the heart of the Sleeper drone. Inside each one is a small array of chemicals and components, all of which play a role in producing the often violent chemical reactions that provide power to the drones. Only the most advanced Sleeper drones are known to have had their power cores enhanced in this way.   Even though they all share the same fundamental role, thousands of minor variations in the machines that have emerged after millennia of use, as they adapted to the minute changes in chemical composition and electrical flux. How exactly they came to do this remains a mystery, but it is clear that the current product is the result of countless iterations.   Although salvaged easily enough, they have been built from the ground up to be integrated into other Sleeper technology. Trying to enhance any engineering systems outside of the Sleeper's own thermoelectric power cores with the current level of technology would represent an impossible reverse-engineering task.|1148
30254|966|Electromechanical Hull Sheeting|These ultra-thin nanoplastic sheets are resilient enough to survive the explosion of the Sleeper drones that carry them. The molecular-level circuitry inside them can be encased in layers of protective fullerene alloys that are billions of times their size, allowing electronics systems to be safely embedded just beneath the armor surface.|1148
30258|966|Resonance Calibration Matrix|RCM play an important role in stabilizing a ship's alignment prior to, and in the first moments of, interstellar warp. The Sleeper drone RCM system works in an entirely different manner to contemporary Empire-based technology and yet the angles of alignment produced by their final calculations are always identical. Even though their inner workings remain a mystery, the matrices operate in a predictable and reliable enough fashion to form the basis of a new, slightly more efficient jump drive.|1148
30259|966|Melted Nanoribbons|Most of these tiny circuits have fused together from the heat and force of the Sleeper drone's explosion. The detonation of the drone's power core must have been immense to have had such an effect on these resilient nanostructures.|1148
30268|966|Jump Drive Control Nexus|Barely salvageable from the wreck of a Sleeper drone, this device could have been something much more impressive when it was fully functional. In its current state it is almost unrecognizable, having been scratched, burned and even chemically melted. It looks like it was housed next to the drone's power core, which would explain the extreme heat damage it suffered when the drone exploded.   Stranger yet, it almost seems as if it was lined with some kind of triggered-release corrosive. The self-destruct mechanism  if that's even what it was  only caused so much damage, and the acid didn't burn cleanly through the center of the drive.   Even as a shadow of its former self, it can be combined with other components to form a fully functional warp drive. Being capable of this, even in such a bad state, strongly suggests that the device was capable of other types of more advanced interstellar travel. Why a Sleeper drone was equipped with this level of technology remains a mystery.|1148
30269|966|Defensive Control Node|A rudimentary analysis of this device reveals an amazingly broad potential for the manipulation of nanomachines, allowing the user to reprogram them for numerous roles. The Sleeper defensive systems were so modular that, even though this particular node was designed to coordinate armor-repairing nanoassemblers, it could just as easily be reconfigured for shield defense.|1148
30270|966|Central System Controller|Still fully intact and operational, this device stands as a testament to the ancient Sleeper's impressive scientific achievements. Although thousands of years old, the technology inside it is not only comparable to modern electronic designs, but in some cases even exceeds it.   Central system controllers lie at the heart of a starship's electronics systems. They are responsible for coordinating the flow of information between various analyzers and control nodes, monitoring subsystems, and ensuring they receive the appropriate supply of electrical power. Tackling such complex tasks simultaneously (and with near-zero latency) demands immense processing power and faultless, error-free programming. Traditionally, a CSC would comprise a significant portion of the cost in a starship's electronics systems, but the fullerene-based Sleeper designs have provided breakthroughs in the efficiency of circuitry and presented new and improved methods for increasing computational accuracy. The end result is a drastically reduced cost for top-of-the-line performance. |1148
30271|966|Emergent Combat Intelligence|Although emergent systems are not fully-fledged Artificial Intelligences, they are often so advanced that they can border on sentience. The means by which they are created is also a common source for claims that they are in fact, full-blown AIs. Emergent system development is said to have been an early focal point in Jovian software design, where they hoped to create an atmosphere in which an advanced system could self-assemble its own consciousness and thus emerge as a sentient being. What became of these projects remains unknown, although the Jovians appear to have abandoned these pursuits many millennia ago in favor of something more tangible and containable.    Designed from the ground up to perform complex, real-time combat calculations such as weapon tracking and heat optimization, this device shows the signatures of an emergent intelligence. Despite this, various hard limitations have been encoded into the device at the most fundamental level, greatly limiting its potential to evolve any further. Even in its current state though, it represents some of the most advanced combat electronics ever built. Although nothing about the software is in itself revolutionary, it is able to tackle highly complex tasks with a frightening level of speed and efficiency.|1148

Scandium is a grey-white element that has historically been incredibly hard to find.

30464|964|Metallofullerene Plating|Metallofullerene plating is used to protect the connective joins in hull and subsystem structures so that Tech III vessels can be taken apart and put back together endlessly, all without the risk of wear. Mechanical engineers first attempted to create the plating using plutonium metallofullerenes, but it was quickly discovered that even miniscule amounts of them had a sizeable impact on ship mass. When integrated into armor plating in larger amounts, they also risked turning the vessel into a giant warhead, something even less desirable.   A solution was finally found. Tiny amounts of metallofullerenes would be integrated in conjunction with far larger quantities of graphene nanoribbons and then coated in powdered C-540 graphite. This process allowed the material to maintain structural durability whilst keeping mass down. The last and most ingenious addition was to incorporate fulleroferrocene into the metal beneath layers of electromechanical hull sheeting. This had the effect of turning the normally dangerous explosive reactions into kinetic energy, which could then be used to supplement the power supply to local nanoassemblers.|1147

30470|964|Neurovisual Output Analyzer|As a capsuleer, few things are more important in space-flight than the ability to instantly gauge one's surroundings and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, capsules inside starships make frequent use of neurovisual reproductions; emulations that recreate external stimuli using the most low-latency processor available: the human brain. This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After the data is captured, it is then relayed directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously.  The synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting. Even though capsuleers have an innate resistance to neurobiological damage from these sorts of processes, the near- constant exposure to them has been linked to increased risk of aggressive neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, engineers have begun to integrate neurovisual output analyzers into a starship's electronics systems. These devices monitor the pilot's status and, if necessary, take measures to protect against anything from mild headaches to catastrophic neural failure.|1147

30474|964|Nanowire Composites|Nanowire composites function as connective links between subsystems. Graphene nanoribbons form the base of the components, carrying electrical power between other devices integrated into electromechanical hull sheets. A final coating of thermal diffusion film ensures efficient heat dispersion, allowing a starship captain to overload modules connected to subsystems without risking the entire vessel.|1147

30476|964|Fulleroferrocene Power Conduits|These conduits supply power to minute, molecular-level devices. Extremely strong and yet surprising flexible, they have traditionally been used in rare situations where the normal methods of power supply were rendered impossible. The advent of Tech III starship technology and the influx of fullerene-based materials have seen the conduits take on new and more widespread roles.   The addition or removal of a single subsystem in a Tech III vessel can drastically change the ship's structure, and with it the internal wiring and available power supply routes.  Fulleroferrocene power conduits have become an essential component in the construction of these new vessels for this very reason. The conduits can be remapped through a ship with relative ease, allowing for the near-endless variations of subsystems to be completely interchangeable without posing any problems of how to power them.|1147

30478|964|Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator|Subspace calibrators perform the crucial role of tuning in on subspace frequencies. Being able to accurately pinpoint a destination on the other side of a wormhole is vital to interstellar travel, as it allows pilots to traverse wormholes safe in the knowledge that they won't accidentally arrive out the other side at the centre of a sun.   This particular calibrator was produced from a combination of fullerene polymers and salvaged Sleeper technology. The unique grouping enables some drastic reconfigurations to the basic design. The end result is a vastly increased efficiency in calculation time. Due to the modular design of Tech III vessels, tuning into subspace frequencies must be done individually for each subsystem. The development of this particular component has been an important time-saver in an area where mere seconds can mean life or death.|1147

30558|971|Malfunctioning Thruster Sections|After millennia of exposure to space, these thruster sections have begun to wear significantly, offering only a limited example of their full functionality. The modular design of Sleeper propulsion systems is still observable however, and is notably similar to that of the empires, only deviating in a few interesting areas.  A determined and lucky researcher could still successfully reverse engineer something useful from this, but they would certainly stand a better chance with a more functional design. |1149
30562|971|Wrecked Thruster Sections|Originally misidentified by the analyzers as nothing more than scrap, these ancient thruster sections are only marginally more than that. Whether it was centuries of radiation or some violent explosion countless years ago, these thrusters have been damaged long ago and are now in a state of advanced erosion as a result.   The modular design of the Sleeper propulsion systems appears to be similar to empire technology, with only slight deviations observable. Perhaps there are secrets to the Sleeper propulsion designs locked away inside these broken relics, but it would take a significant amount of luck for even a skilled researcher to successfully reverse engineer them and find out. |1149
30582|992|Intact Power Cores|Rescued from a crumbling Sleeper structure, these ancient power cores stand as an excellent example of Sleeper engineering. Unlike everything else that surrounded them, these cores appeared to be almost newly-manufactured.

30744|880|Neural Network Analyzer|Even millennium old, this bulky piece of equipment shows barely any sign of age. The explosion of the Sleeper drone ferrying it around doesn't seem to have affected it in any way, either. This device was clearly built to last.  A cursory analysis of the software systems within reveals that it operates as some kind of monitoring device. The specialized design suggests it was used to process vast amounts of basic data and identify anomalies.  Given its age and unique design, there would likely be very few who could make sense of the programming. Those who do recognize the value of such a component, however, would likely be willing to part with a significant sum of ISK to own it. |1109
30745|880|Sleeper Data Library|Found amongst the debris of an incapacitated Sleeper drone, this large device appears to be a data archive of some sort. Although the information within remains a complete mystery, it is immediately apparent that it stretches far back into time.  Small data fragments preceding each file appear to function as time-stamps. If this is indeed what they are, then this Data Library could offer a snapshot of the universe stretching back millennia.  Although it is obviously of great value in and of itself, those who have some basic understanding of interpreting the data would undoubtedly pay the most for it, should an opportunistic salvager wish to part with such a rare piece of technology. |1109
30746|880|Ancient Coordinates Database|Recovered from the wrecked hull of a Sleeper drone, this database stands as a testament to the lasting power of their ancient technology. Not only has it managed to survive for millennia completely intact, but it has come through the violence of its bearer's destruction without even a scratch.   A brief analysis of the technology inside reveals that the database may in fact still be fully functional. The format and layout of the information within suggests it is a list of three-dimensional coordinates, charting a path to some distant place.   Although this device could hold incredibly valuable information, there would only be a handful of people in the entire cluster that could make any sense of it. Finding a buyer may not be that easy. |1109
30747|880|Sleeper Drone AI Nexus|Rescued from the ruined hull of a Sleeper drone, this AI Nexus represents the digital soul of these strange creations. Although the technology behind the Sleeper AI is for the most part recognizable, this device offers some insight into the few mysterious aspects that are not.  As coveted as this component must be, only the foremost drone technicians in all of New Eden would be able to possibly find some use in it. There is little doubt however that the promise such a thing holds would ensure they paid a tidy sum. |1109
30752|997|Intact Hull Section|Found drifting amongst the ruins of a Sleeper compound, these large sections of a Sleeper vessel represent a significant archaeological discovery. Not only is the hull itself an incredibly rare find, but the excellent condition it is in makes this a particularly useful case study for the Sleeper's ship construction methods.  Pristine, working examples of Sleeper technology such as this are extremely rare and even more valuable. With the right skills and equipment, they can offer great insights into the scientific pursuits of the ancient race that designed them. |1149
30753|997|Malfunctioning Hull Section|Found drifting amongst the ruins of a Sleeper compound, these large sections of a Sleeper vessel represent a significant archaeological discovery. The hull itself is an incredibly rare find, tainted only by the condition it is in. Although it was clearly built to survive the stress of space, the countless years of environmental exposure have still taken a heavy toll, stripping from it a great deal of the original functionality.   Even despite the damage, it would still make a respectable case study for the Sleeper's vessel construction methods. A skilled scientist could still possibly extract enough information to try and reverse engineer it. |1149
30754|997|Wrecked Hull Section|Mistakenly identified by the analyzers as a derelict structure, these ancient Sleeper hull fragments are almost entirely destroyed. Whether slow erosion or some more rapid and violent event devastated the technology remains unclear. It is simply too badly damaged to make an educated guess.   There isn't much of a chance that anything useful could be reverse engineered from such badly ruined fragments, but there is little doubt that those few lucky researchers who successfully managed it would uncover the secrets to Sleeper hull designs. For many, that opportunity alone would be worth the gamble. |1149

One of the outcomes of that research was an improvement on the Osprey, whose versatility and low manufacturing cost made it a natural candidate for improvements. The resulting vessel maintained the shield defenses known among similar ships of its type, while adding an array of remarkable black ops capabilities. In fact, it is reputed that initial prototypes were employed to spy on interstellar activities near the recaptured Caldari Prime, as part of Tibus Heth's continually growing espionage initiative.

Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.  Ostensibly a civilian transport corporation, InterBus claims it possesses no military capabilities. Despite this, small numbers of Catalyst hulls bearing the corporation's distinctive yellow color scheme continue to circulate among capsuleers. InterBus has thus far declined to make any comment on their provenance, which if anything has raised their value among collectors.|1613

Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.  The Intaki Syndicate fields large numbers of Catalysts as deep-space patrol craft. Its heavy armament lets it punch well above their weight, and its expansive cargo bay allows it to cruise for months between supply stops. Recently though, the Syndicate has retired a considerable number of its older hulls, with rumors suggesting their imminent replacement by a newer destroyer design.

Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.  Inner Zone Shipping's main claim to fame is as the Bank of Luminaire's preferred courier for high-value shipments. Catalysts are their preferred escort craft, combining high speed and maneuverability with an extremely heavy punch. For its highest-value runs, IZS prefers to use brand-new hulls, which are then immediately sold off after use to prevent unscrupulous elements from tracking their ID numbers. While most of these ships are repainted and sold as stock, Inner Zone has discovered a lucrative sideline in selling a few on to capsuleer collectors, who place a premium on ships with interesting histories.|1613

One of their recent successes has been the distribution of limited-edition Quafe ships to eager capsuleers, and this Catalyst is one of their latest offerings. While functionally just a stock Catalyst, this ship's iridescent blue paint job and prominent Quafe logos makes it a highly sought-after collector's item - as well as an unmissable advert for Quafe's market-leading range of thirst-quenching beverages!|1613

Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.  Aliastra purchased a large fleet of Catalysts several years ago, to protect its inter-Empire shipping routes. Subsequent evaluations determined that the Catalyst was considerably over-gunned for many of its safer routes, so 30% of their hulls were sold off and replaced by cheaper frigates. Some of these ships have since been retro-fitted for capsuleer use, and their distinctive color scheme makes them something of a collector's item.|1613
32853|1083|SPZ-3 "Torch" Laser Sight Combat Ocular Enhancer (right/black)|The product of a collaborative effort between the State Protectorate and Zainou, the "Torch" is already seeing adoption in military circles, where it functions as a precision-guidance tool for a covert class of sharpshooters working either in low-light conditions or with explosive ordinance.  Surprisingly, it has also seen increased adoption by other sections of the warfaring population, even cropping up among capsuleers. Superstition has already bound to it in use in orbital bombardment; there is no practical reason to believe that it actually aids in the process, but capsuleers have sworn that it helps ensure the precision-point contact necessary for successful bombardment and the ensuing explosive ignition of the correct groups of people.|1408

In this it reflects well-honed Gallente values, which include taking independent action without taking forever to wait for a committee decision, and also doing so, if at all possible, in a fashion that allows for a nice, safe buffer for immediate retreat; because theory is one thing, and practice is sometimes quite another.  As such, the Algos focuses on being able to hit its targets in rapid-fire fashion, with guns that fire fast and drones that race through space with destruction in mind.|467

This includes not only imposing the will of God, often through the time-honored methods of mindless proxies, but also profiting, even being nourished, off the energies of others.  As such, the Dragoon focuses on sending out a mass of drones, ones capable not only of swiftly hunting down their targets but also of inflicting tons of damage once contact is made. Moreover, the Dragoon is able to drain the target's energy in the meanwhile, all with the aim of leaving it little more than a trembling husk.|465

This applies equally to peace talks as it does to actual engagements on the battlefield - there should be no doubt in the strength of Caldari spirit, nor in the fact that when one blow has been struck, others are going to follow.  As such, the Corax does not pepper its opponents with pellets from a gun, nor does it toast them with continuous beams of light. Instead, it delivers strong, hard-hitting payloads at a pace that's not only steady, but rapid enough to rock its targets and knock them off-balance.|466

Irrespective of numbers, firepower and circumstances, their strategy when engaged in combat often revolves around the same central tenet: Stay untouchable as much as you can, either by sneaking around or rushing in, do as much damage as fast as you can, and get out before you get killed.  As such, the Talwar does not come equipped to hang around forever on the battlefield. It is built to rush around at speed without getting caught, and to hit very hard and very, very fast.|468

It is for reasons like this that one must be careful about choosing what portrait they present to the public. By the end of this book you will understand how to properly select a good public portrait that properly represents you.

One recent success has been the commissioning of a fledgling patrol fleet to protect the tribe's new spaceborne assets: as other tribes have stocked up on newer Talwar-class destroyers, the Nefantar have managed to acquire a large stock of older Thrashers for their own use. Keen to raise their visibility within the Minmatar Republic, they have been more than happy to allow willing capsuleers to acquire surplus hulls on the condition that they remain painted in Nefantar colors.|1613
